When I typed that code into the runner, it didn't run at all, because Chrome detected the error. But, I ran it somewhere else and it ran the way I expected. The browser alerts "Hello!" but the second line defines 'alert' as a number. It was previously defined as a function. Variables don't take inputs like functions do, so writing alert() produces an error. alert is no longer a function.
