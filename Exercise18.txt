When the script is run, a function is defined, 'shout,' then executed. That function defines a message within the scope of that function and then alerts that message. The final line of code returns an error because var message has only been defined within the scope of the function. It doesn't exist outside of the fuction. This could be changed by declaring var message; before declaring the function and then using the function to set message = "HEY YOU!"; that would let Javascript know that message is a global variable, and the function shout() will change its value.
